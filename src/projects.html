  <p>Selected things I’ve built to give people a little more leverage.</p>

  <h3>T-Shirt Extravaganza</h3>
  <p>
    I sent an email to every startup company in the world asking for a free T-Shirt. <br> <br>
    To do this I used several data scraping tools like Scrapy &amp; Selenium, as well as Google Bard Exploitation with fifty Google accounts to find company names and emails of over 5000 startups. The results are I received over 90 T-Shirts, 10 Water Bottles, 17 booklets and hundreds of stickers! <br> <br>
    At peak, I hit Bard with &gt;1500 requests a minute.

  <h3>Swyftx: Boosting Team Efficiency</h3>
  <p>
    At Swyftx, my manager wanted me to increase team efficiency, so I created Python macros in my free time to speed up my workflow and ended up making my team 10% more efficient, bringing us to the #1/14 position in the team efficiency chart.

  <h3>Cannology</h3>
  <p>
    I started my first business at 15, and I'm now the owner of the business Cannology. We are now sold in over 50 pharmacies across Australia.<br> <br>
    The business takes up a small part of each week and is something I love building in the background. I’m currently emailing every chemist in Australia to become a stockist, all automated with Python &amp; ChatGPT. <a href="https://Cannology.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Visit Website</a>.
