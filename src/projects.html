  <p>Selected things I’ve built to give people a little more leverage.</p>

  <h3>T-Shirt Extravaganza</h3>
  <p>
    I emailed startups around the world asking for a free T‑shirt. Scrapy and Selenium handled the data collection, while scripted prompt runs surfaced names and emails for 5,000+ companies. The haul: 90+ shirts, 10 water bottles, 17 booklets, and more stickers than I could count. Peak throughput cleared 1,500 requests a minute.

  <h3>Swyftx: Boosting Team Efficiency</h3>
  <p>
    We hit #1 out of 14 support teams after I rolled out Python macros that automated the repetitive parts of our workflow. Faster responses, fewer mistakes, happier customers.
  </p>

  <h3>Cannology</h3>
  <p>
    I started Cannology at 15. It’s now stocked in 50+ pharmacies across Australia and gives me a sandbox for experiments in automation, fulfilment, and customer development. I’m currently using Python and ChatGPT to scale outreach to new stockists. <a href="https://Cannology.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Visit Website</a>.
