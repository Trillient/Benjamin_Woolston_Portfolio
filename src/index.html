    <strong>T-Shirt Extravaganza</strong><br>
    I sent an email to every startup company in the world asking for a free T-Shirt. To do this I used several data scraping tools like Scrapy & Selenium, as well as Google Bard exploitation with fifty Google accounts to find company names and emails of over 5000 startups. The results: I received over 90 T-Shirts, 10 water bottles, 17 booklets and hundreds of stickers! At peak, I hit Bard with more than 1500 requests a minute.

    <strong>E-commerce Website</strong><br>
    I started my first business at 15, and I'm now the owner of the business Cannology. We are now sold in over 50 pharmacies across Australia. The business takes up a small part of each week and is something I love building in the background. Iâ€™m currently emailing every chemist in Australia to become a stockist, all automated with Python & ChatGPT. <a href="https://Cannology.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Visit Website</a>.
